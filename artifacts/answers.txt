1.Solution:

To solve it, simply use the mathematical theory of sets. From this intersection we always remove 5 friends from the other sets, which communicate directly with it.

1. We have an intersection, with 5 friends who drink beer and soda.
2. 8 friends drink soda;
3. 5 friends drink beer;


And to calculate the total, we add up all the contents of the sets and their intersections. In the end, we have a total of 18 people in the party.



2.Solution:

To calculate we must know the difference in minutes between the time set by Sarah and the actual time, which is ahead of time. Obtained from this calculation:

Time difference -> 10 -(-5) = 15 minutes

From this difference, we can exactly predict the actual time shown on Sarah's watch to be sure if Sarah is late, early or on time.  

With her suspected 15 min late, we check based on the time difference and observe that she is on time.

The next calculation would be to get the value of the early time, we would observe that it does not exist:

Extra time -> x -(-15) = 15 => x + 15 = 15 => x = 15 -15 => x = 0


3.The value of the first offer is, abstractly a notation as follows:

Product value -> x 
Discount applied -> x/2
Notation -> x + x/2  

However this can also be represented as follows:
x+x/2 => 2x/2 + x/2 => 3x/2

The equivalent value of 3x/2 represents the total product value, and its abstract and representative form also makes clear its mathematical proportion. 

From this abstraction we can observe, through proportionality, that the correct answer would be letter C.


4.According to the text, we observe that Sarah remembers 4 of the 8 numbers, from Lorraine's contact. Thus decreasing the amount of possible combinations, as well as the criteria of the possibility of not having repeated numbers. 

Then we just need to define them, realizing the possible arithmetic combinations, with the theory of combinatory analysis and permutation.

*x -> Represents the remembered and fixed numbers
*numbers -> Other numbers, are the quantity of numbers, per position that can be applied.


|x|x|x|x|6|5|4|3| => 360 possible combinations


Important detail, since the numbers cannot be repeated, it is necessary to remove any 4 numbers from the amount.
